# Ultra-Low Cost (ULC) malaria scope

Welcome to the ULC Malaria Scope! We are developing a barebones optical microscope with embedded computing hardware capable of dianosing malaria in fresh, whole blood with no fixation, staining, or preparation steps. No highly trained technicians will be required to perform time-consuming sample preparation or manual scoring of parasites under the microscope. The target BOM cost is $250.
